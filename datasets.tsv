It is additionally divided by gender (male, female). The present list further contains ratings of the same items given by adults in [Syssau and Font (2005)](:bib:Syssau2005). The items were chosen based on the emotional databases by [Bonin, Méot et al. 2003](:bib:Bonin2003) and [Syssau and Font (2005)](:bib:Syssau2005), licensed as Emotional Source in the dataset. While these original studies were conducted using pictures, the present study used only the corresponding words, either spoken (age group five) or written (age groups seven and nine).
Dingemanse-2020-IconicityHumor	Dingemanse, Mark and Thompson, Bill	2020	ratings	English	English	https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2019.49	Dingemanse2020	This list contains ratings of iconicity and humor, given both by human participants and as computational ratings. We included only the computational ratings and the iconicity ratings from [Perry et al. (2018)](:bib:Perry2018) since the humor ratings from [Engelthaler and Hills (2018)](:bib:Engelthaler2018) were added as separate dataset. The human ratings were compared to the ratings given by the computational model developed for the present study, which was trained on large natural language corpora. The study also includes ratings of aversion and taboos, which were not included here.

Further, ratings of familiarity ([Su et al. 2023a](:bib:Su2023a)) and imageability ([Su et al. 2023b](:bib:Su2023b)) were included here since this data is only available in PDF format elsewhere or the file was corrupted.
Amenta-2025-LexicalRecognition	Amenta, Simona and de Varda, Andrea Gregor and Mandera, Pawel and Keuleers, Emmanuel and Brysbaert, Marc and Marelli, Marco	2025	norms	Italian	Italian	https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-024-02548-4	Amenta2025	This list contains lexical recognition times for 130,495 Italian words from the Italian Crowdsourcing Project (ICP). Words were originally selected from SUBTLEX-IT ([Crepaldi et al. 2015](:bib:Crepaldi2015)), enriched with inflected forms, rare/morphologically complex words, dictionary entries, and some modern neologisms, then cleaned to remove names, punctuation, and offensive content. Ratings were given by Italian native speakers. Unlike in classic lexical decision tasks, participants were not prompted ro react as quickly as possible but rather to indicate whether they recognized a given word in their own time.	ICP
Redondo-2007-AffectiveRatings	Redondo, Jaime and Fraga, Isabel and Padrón, Isabel and Comesaña, Montserrat	2007	ratings	English	Spanish	https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03193031	Redondo2007	This list contains ratings of valence, arousal and dominance of Spanish words. The data is presented as the mean of all participants' responses, female participants' and male participants' responses. The dataset is a translation of the ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) list ([Bradley and Lang 1999](:bib:Bradley1999)). Additional data from the Spanish lexical database LEXESP by [Sebastian-Galles et al. (2000)](:bib:Sebastian2000) in this dataset include concreteness and imageability ratings. Two additional LEXESP variables, namely objective frequency and familiarity, can be found in a separate dataset (see [Desrochers et al. (2010)](:bib:Desrochers2010)).	
Ljubesic-2020-Emotions	Ljubešić, Nikola and Markov, Ilia and Fišer, Darrja and Daelemans, Walter	2020	ratings	English	Dutch, Croatian, Slovene	https://aclanthology.org/2020.peoples-1.15/	Ljubesic2020	This list contains ratings for associations of discrete emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust) as well as their positive/negative valence. The original ratings were conducted in English (Mohammad & Turney [2010](:bib:Mohammad2010)). This study also provided translations for Dutch, Croatian, and Slovene which were generated with automated translation tools. The present study conducted manual translations for each Slovene and Croatian word and for each Dutch word that has an association rating in at least one column. Translators were asked to take the sentiment and emotion labels that were already associated with the words into account. It appears that the ratings were taken from the original study in English (Mohammad & Turney [2010](:bib:Mohammad2010)) and the novelty of the dataset lies in the updated translations. However, the authors do not make it clear how the dataset was created, so caution is advised.	LiLaH
Martinez-2025-AffectiveRatings	Martínez, Gonzalo and Molero, Juan Diego and González, Sandra and Conde, Javier and Brysbaert, Marc and Reviriego, Pedro	2025	ratings	English	English	https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-024-02515-z	Martinez2025	This list contains ratings of concreteness, valence and arousal for English items by GPT-4o. The list of words that were rated was sourced from [Warriner et al. 2013](:bib:Warriner2013) and extended. Concreteness was rated on a 5-point scale while valence and arousal were rated on 9-point scales. Soundness of the LLM ratings was ensured by collecting real human ratings and comparing them to the answers given by GPT-4o.

Soares-2012-AffectiveRatings	Soares, Ana Paula and Comesaña, Montserrat and Pinheiro, Ana P and Simões, Alberto and Frade, Carla Sofia	2012	ratings	Portuguese	Portuguese	https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-011-0131-7	Soares2012	This list contains ratings of valence, arousal and dominance for 1,034 Portuguese words. These words were selected from the Affective Norms for English Words (ANEW) database [(Bradley & Lang, 1999)](:bib:Bradley1999) and compared to the Spanish translation used for a similar study conducted by [Redondo et al. (2007)](bib:Redondo2007). The Portuguese translation used here was therefore heavily influenced by the Spanish one used previously. The original dataset provides ratings separately for all, male, and female participants. The present mappings include only the ratings for all participants.
